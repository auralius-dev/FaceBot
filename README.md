# FaceBot

## What is it?
**FaceBot** is a discord bot that sends generated images from [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) and some other websites.
## is it *useful*?
For generating faces yes. But not really.
#### Notes
This bot does not have any spam prevention. If commands are spammed the bot will crash and also send [corrupted images](https://github.com/auralius-dev/FaceBot/blob/master/images/fast/5.jpg).  I would love to know why this happens. c:
